# Project status

**Updated:** 2026-07-21  
**Stage:** Phase 1 — static analysis and archive recovery in progress

## Now

- Planning and documentation system established.
- Original installation inventoried without executing binaries.
- Port strategy recorded in ADR-0001.
- Complete iOS port checklist and input/control/haptics system specified;
  semantic input architecture recorded in ADR-0002.
- Local Git repository initialized on branch `main`; planning baseline committed
  as `59828ed`.
- GitHub remote `tryk016/airfix-dogfighter` connected and the planning baseline
  published.
- Phase 1 toolchain installed and pinned: Ghidra 12.1.2, Temurin JDK 21.0.11,
  Python 3.14.6, CMake 4.4.0, Ninja 1.13.2, LLVM 22.1.8, and GCC 15.2.0.
- Initial LLVM report for `UdsPack.dll` found 44 named C++ exports covering
  `UpPackage`, `UpFile`, `UpFileInfo`, and `UpHashTable`.
- Recovered the complete header layout, both 24-byte record layouts, legacy
  signed-byte name hash, and compression opcodes for FMT-UDSP.
- Implemented portable C++20 metadata parser, listing/verifier CLI, decompressor,
  and malformed-input tests.
- All five supplied archives and all 1,911 compressed streams pass the new
  parser; original data remains external and read-only.
- Added three-platform portable CI including native ARM64 `macos-26`.
- Generated reproducible LLVM sections/imports/exports reports for all 16 PE
  modules and confirmed the plugin factory ABI names.
- Changed normal UDSP file opening to read only the header and metadata tail;
  `Resource.up` metadata buffering fell from 170,642,453 to 130,961 bytes.
- Draft PR #1 is published; portable CI passes on Ubuntu, Windows, and ARM64
  macOS 26, including the post-fix AFPACK streaming tests on Windows.
- Added a data-less UIKit/Metal iPhone shell generated through CMake, a portable
  lifecycle/content state machine, and a public-source boundary scanner.
- Unsigned ARM64 `iphoneos` and `iphonesimulator` builds pass on Xcode 26.6 with
  verified minimum iOS 16.4 and no private files in either bundle.
- Recovered package-chain startup and the type/mode/graphics plugin discovery,
  version gates, metadata, factory calls, and unloading behavior.
- Classified `Dogfighter.exe` as the usable v1.01 bootstrap reference and the
  near-maximal-entropy `.icd` as an older protected/compressed artifact.
- Specified AFPACK v1 and implemented its bounded parser, deterministic local
  writer, streaming SHA-256 verifier, normalized-path checks, and atomic partial
  output behavior.
- Added explicit archive/metadata/entry/path/string-table/payload ceilings before
  allocation or reads. Bounded file-backed entry reads verify SHA-256 and reject
  both changed file size and same-size payload replacement.
- Added bounded UDSP-in-container reads and completed a real English content
  pack round trip (192,755,765 bytes, 3 entries) outside Git; the temporary pack
  was removed after verification.
- Inventoried the selected Resource/English payload set and validated portable
  GTI metadata parsing for 1,985 files/3,990 image variants plus CCF framing for
  all 286 scene signatures.
- Recovered GTI pixel-size/alpha/palette semantics and CCF's inclusive
  six-byte nested chunks plus the four stable top-level scene sections.
- Indexed every direct child in all 286 CCF scenes; material/room IDs are
  stable, and the independent blueprint/placed-node tables have equal physical
  counts in every file but no assumed index mapping.
- Implemented faithful base-level RGBA8 conversion for every observed GTI pixel
  format and decoded all 3,990 variants; a private aircraft texture diagnostic
  confirms channel/orientation correctness and the paletted/32-bit paths agree
  closely.
- Implemented bounded `AfChunkContainer` framing and object-definition parsing;
  all 299 selected containers/7,376 chunks and all 215 object definitions pass.
- Implemented strict CCF material metadata parsing for all 10,385 records,
  exposing material names/references and 10,256 primary plus 263 environment
  texture dependencies without assigning unproven numeric semantics.
- Audited the CC0 `RonnyReverse/cc-tools` project at a pinned commit; its CCF
  mesh map is useful independent evidence, while the local bounded parser and
  corpus/Ghidra validation remain authoritative.
- Implemented bounded CCF mesh geometry parsing for all 6,995 records,
  validating 136,363 vertices and 170,039 indexed triangles plus UV, paint,
  transform, and control metadata without exporting proprietary geometry.
- Added bounded UDSP logical-path lookup with legacy hash/case behavior, full
  collision comparison, traversal rejection, and explicit ambiguous results as
  the first dependency-resolver primitive.
- Indexed all 9,328 CCF blueprints as 2,062 roots and 7,266 ordered edges with
  maximum depth 7 and zero missing parents, duplicate references, or cycles.
  Resolved all 215 object `CCFF`/`MESH` selectors through 90 mesh roots, 124 null
  roots, and one no-selector case.
- Implemented the portable deterministic input core: stable action IDs, Q15
  axes, bounded sequence ordering, multi-source arbitration, context releases,
  cancellation, lifecycle neutral gating, and default touch/controller/test
  bindings. Native iOS adapters and the visual touch overlay remain pending.
- Established the recovered right-handed CCF basis, row-vector matrix
  convention, reverse-cross winding, degenerate `+Y` normal, and raw UV policy;
  the bounded API-neutral converter validates all 6,995 corpus meshes.
- Implemented owned RGBA8 decoding for complete GTI mip chains. Corpus policy
  uploads all authored levels for 3,974 variants and uses base-plus-Metal
  generation for 16 legacy dimension anomalies, decoding 9,539 levels safely.
- Recovered the engine's exact `TEXU\\source.gti` lookup rule. Full selected
  subtrees cover 2,687 blueprint nodes, 1,858 mesh instances, 2,842 material
  uses, and 2,959 uniquely resolved texture edges with no dependency errors.
- Implemented a deterministic seam-safe draw-mesh payload plus bounded CPU
  rasterizer. A private 111-triangle textured model renders correctly in both
  explicit V policies; generated PPM/PNG files remain ignored and outside Git.
- Confirmed that object loading skips the independent `0x4000` placed table,
  selects a `0x3000` blueprint by name, and recursively instances descendants.
  The bounded graph resolver and multi-instance diagnostic render a private
  grouped aircraft containing 46 nodes, 25 mesh instances, 21 null groups, 663
  triangles, and maximum depth 3. Raw V preserves its markings; explicit V flip
  does not. Private outputs remain ignored and outside Git.
- Implemented finite, invertible parent-relative local transform derivation and
  composition in runtime column-vector order. Round-trip tests include
  non-commutative rotations and shear; `rawScalar` is not treated as scale.

## Confirmed

- Reference readme identifies v1.01.
- 33 files total 356,442,590 bytes.
- All 16 executable modules inspected are PE32/x86.
- `.mode` and `.type` files are DLLs despite custom extensions.
- `Resource.up` and language `.up` files begin with `UDSP 01 01` and are not
  standard archives recognized by 7-Zip.
- Original rendering uses Direct3D/DirectX 7-era interfaces and optional Glide.
- The locked Phase 1 toolchain is installed and its versions and source hashes
  are recorded in `docs/toolchain/LOCK.md`.
- The iOS control baseline requires full touch-only play plus controller-only
  play, hot-plug recovery, remapping, deterministic input frames, safe-area
  layouts, and optional haptics.
- Accepted v1.0 scope: private sideload only, iOS 16.4 minimum deployment target,
  iPhone 17 Pro Max/iOS 26.6 and iPhone SE 3/iOS 26.3 runtime devices, Apple
  Developer account available, single-player only, no editors/multiplayer, and
  no original CD music.
- GitHub Actions hosted macOS/Xcode is the accepted iOS build/signing host; no
  local Mac is required. CI currently builds unsigned data-less bundles; future
  private signing produces an IPA while original data remains local in an
  imported `.afpack`.
- MacBook policy accepted: request a move only for a clearly reported hard
  blocker or documented >=20% acceleration of the affected remaining work.

## Next

1. Decode the independent `0x4000` placed graph needed for a faithful first
   room; static grouped-aircraft rendering and parent-relative local math are
   complete.
2. Implement AFPACK manifest semantic checks and the transactional iOS import
   service; the converter's no-music configuration is now tested.
3. Connect the draw payload and texture upload policy to the Metal shell, first
   with unlit/no-cull diagnostics and then with evidence-backed render states.
4. Implement native UIKit and Game Controller adapters over the deterministic
   input router, then add the configurable safe-area-aware touch overlay.

## Open questions

- Which Windows-compatible method will install the signed Actions IPA on both
  registered phones?
- Should faithful 4:3 framing or expanded widescreen be the default?

These questions do not block static analysis or the archive work.

## Blockers

- None for Phase 1 static analysis.
- The connected repository is public. Before the first signed device spike,
  signed IPA artifacts must be encrypted/protected (or repository visibility
  deliberately changed), because provisioning data must not be published.
- A signing certificate/profile for both device UDIDs, protected Actions
  secrets, and a Windows IPA installation path are required before that spike.
- No public distribution is planned; private signed/converted artifacts must not
  be shared.
- No MacBook blocker exists in the current project phase.
