## 2026-07-21 — initial non-executing audit

- `EV-20260721-001`: source folder contains 33 files totaling 356,442,590 bytes.
- `EV-20260721-002`: 16 candidate code modules parsed as PE32/x86; `.mode` and
  `.type` are DLLs.
- `EV-20260721-003`: `Resource.up` and `English.up` begin with `UDSP 01 01`;
  7-Zip does not recognize them as archives.
- `EV-20260721-004`: readme reports v1.01 and DirectX 7/Direct3D plus Glide
  rendering paths.
- `EV-20260721-005`: readme says music requires the game CD; no standalone music
  files appear in the installation inventory.
- Created ADR-0001, architecture, detailed roadmap, workflow, and initial parity
  matrix.
- Initialized the local Git repository and committed the planning baseline as
  `59828ed`.
- No original binaries were executed or modified.

## 2026-07-21 — iOS product and input requirements

- Designed the semantic action/input-context architecture and deterministic
  per-tick `InputFrame` contract.
- Specified touch flight stick, latching throttle, weapons, camera, multi-touch,
  layout profiles, handedness, calibration, controller mapping/hot-plug, and
  phone/controller haptics.
- Added lifecycle failure behavior for cancellation, backgrounding, overlays,
  audio interruption, and controller loss.
- Added complete port checklist covering screen/safe area, rendering,
  performance, thermal state, audio/video, atomic saves, packaging,
  accessibility, localization, security, diagnostics, testing, and release.
- Recorded ADR-0002; no production implementation or original-binary execution
  occurred.

## 2026-07-21 — version 1.0 scope decisions

- Owner confirmed private signed sideload only and explicitly excluded App Store
  distribution.
- Set minimum deployment target to iOS 16.4.
- Recorded available Apple Developer account and iPhone 17 Pro Max as the primary
  physical device; Mac/Xcode host remains unconfirmed.
- Excluded dogfight/multiplayer, House Editor, and Paint Room from v1.0.
- Confirmed that neither the original CD image nor audio tracks are available;
  v1.0 supports absent music and must not source unofficial copies.
- Added `V1-SCOPE.md` and ADR-0003 and updated plan, requirements, and parity
  priorities.

## 2026-07-21 — GitHub Actions and device matrix

- Owner selected GitHub Actions hosted macOS/Xcode for all iOS compilation;
  local Mac/Xcode is not required.
- Kept iOS 16.4 as deployment target while defining runtime coverage only on
  iPhone 17 Pro Max/iOS 26.6 and iPhone SE 3/iOS 26.3.
- Added the compact 4.7-inch Home-button/A15 device path alongside the large
  Dynamic Island/high-refresh device path.
- Designed unsigned pull-request builds and a protected manual signed-IPA job
  with ephemeral keychain, certificate/profile secrets, verification, and
  short-lived artifacts.
- Separated CI-built data-less IPA from a locally converted private `.afpack` so
  original/converted assets never enter GitHub.
- Added ADR-0004 and `docs/ci/GITHUB-ACTIONS-IOS.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — MacBook escalation policy

- Owner confirmed that work may move to a MacBook when genuinely needed.
- Accepted two escalation thresholds: hard blocker without local Xcode/device
  tooling, or a documented estimate of at least 20% acceleration for the
  affected remaining task/milestone.
- Added a required explicit `MACBOOK GATE` notification format, measurement
  formula, likely trigger list, and hybrid Windows/Actions/Mac responsibility
  boundary.
- Current phase does not require a MacBook.
